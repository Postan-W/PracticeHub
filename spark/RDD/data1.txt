In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
Now the earth was [Or possibly became] formless and empty,
darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of
God was hovering over the waters.
God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light
from the darkness.
God called the light “day”, and the darkness he called
“night”. And there was evening, and there was morning —
the first day.
And God said, “Let there be an expanse between the waters
to separate water from water.
